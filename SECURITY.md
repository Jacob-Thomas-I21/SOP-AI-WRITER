# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures, policies, and procedures for the Pharmaceutical SOP Author system. As a healthcare-related application, security is paramount to ensure patient data protection and regulatory compliance.

## üìû Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### üö® **Immediate Action Required**
- **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- **DO NOT** disclose vulnerabilities publicly until patched

### üìß **How to Report**
1. Email security concerns to: `jacob.joshy@example.com`
2. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
3. Provide steps to reproduce the issue
4. Include your contact information for follow-up

### ‚è∞ **Response Timeline**
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Investigation**: Within 3 business days
- **Fix Development**: Within 7-14 days (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and tested

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- **Audit Trails**: Complete audit logging for all user actions
- **Data Integrity**: ALCOA+ principles implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Policies**: Strong password requirements enforced
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Ready for implementation
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with expiration

### Network Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted
- **CORS Policy**: Strict cross-origin resource sharing rules
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization

### Compliance Standards
- **FDA 21 CFR Part 11**: Electronic records and signatures compliance
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation compliance
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- **ALCOA+**: Data integrity principles

## üîç Security Scanning

### Automated Security Tools
- **CodeQL**: Static application security testing (SAST)
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability checking
- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency security analysis
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

### Manual Security Reviews
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code review process
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Compliance Audits**: Annual third-party security audits

## üö® Incident Response

### Incident Classification
- **Critical**: System compromise, data breach, unauthorized access
- **High**: Security vulnerability with exploitation potential
- **Medium**: Security misconfiguration, policy violation
- **Low**: Potential security improvement, false positive

### Response Process
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluates impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems and data
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems from clean backups
5. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvements
